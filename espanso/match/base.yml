# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ";um"
    replace: "unordered_map"
  - trigger: ";us"
    replace: "unordered_set"
  - trigger: ";cross"
    replace: "‚ùå"
  - trigger: ";warn"
    replace: "üî•"
  - trigger: ";tick"
    replace: "‚úÖ"
  - trigger: ";in"
    replace: "ihowson@nvidia.com"
  - trigger: ";ij"
    replace: "ihowson@google.com"
  - trigger: ";im"
    replace: "ian@mutexlabs.com"
  - trigger: ";km"
    replace: "kandice@mutexlabs.com"
  - trigger: ";pkg"
    replace: |

      Unfortunately, I'm not the author of the packages on https://rdrr.io, and I'm not able to provide support for them. You should get in touch with the package authors listed on the package page.
      
      Thanks,

      This issue tracker is just for website issues. We're not able to provide technical support for individual packages. Sorry!

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  #- trigger: ":date"
  #  replace: "{{mydate}}"
  #  vars:
  #    - name: mydate
  #      type: date
  #      params:
  #        format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  #- trigger: ":shell"
  #  replace: "{{output}}"
  #  vars:
  #    - name: output
  #      type: shell
  #      params:
  #        cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"

  # And much more! For more information, visit the docs: https://espanso.org/docs/
